# Getting info from IoT devives
We will use an open-source solution to get the data from IoT devices sensors, and which allows us to add our own code (for additional ways of interaction, made possible using VR).

# Server
Running OpenHab Server on the local machine.

# Connecting to Unity
Getting and sending the data to the server using REST API.

# Virtual Reality
Using a project in Unity to visualize and interact with IoT devices.

# Scheme
