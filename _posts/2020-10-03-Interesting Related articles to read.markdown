Please share interesting articles in here:-)

# 1. VR system moves furniture with robots to make virtual objects real

One of the disadvantages with VR hands tracking is that there is no feedback from virtual objects when user touches them. One of the approaches is to use sensing gloves(like [VRgluv](https://www.vrgluv.com/)), but what about interactions such as sitting on a chair or touching walls? See more in [this article](https://newatlas.com/vr/roomshift-vr-robots-move-furniture/) from CHI 2020.

# 2. Performance Analysis of an IoT Platform with Virtual Reality and Social Media Integration

[Link to the article](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/poncom/2020/230953/Perf_Analysis_IoT_with_VR_and_Social_Media_Integration_WOWMOM_Anderson_Simiscuka.pdf)

I was hoping to see more research from this author, but from what I see, they have not moved much further from the [last year's publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334998014_Real-Virtual_World_Device_Synchronization_in_a_Cloud-Enabled_Social_Virtual_Reality_IoT_Network). Just as in the last paragraph: 
> The average end-to-end delay for actions in the platform
> is approximately 0.88s, which means that, for instance, an
> action performed in the VR environment will be tweeted and
> executed in the real device in less than one second.

Why didn't they analyze performance (i.e provide latency value) for each step, starting from VR and finishing with the tweet post is still a mystery to me. But it's not a problem, this can be calculated easily inside our platform if needed.
