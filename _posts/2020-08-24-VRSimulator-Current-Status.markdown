1. Facebook can't make a good Oculus Quest Asset for Unity
2. Why do I have to write the code by myself? I planned to spend only one day to make the project run in VR, took me 10 days instead
3. Facebook I hate you
4. Connecting Oculus to the computer (using it as a controller) is not easy at all. And seems very hard to do it writing the code myself, so I decided to run the APP as an APK on Oculus device, not on the PC.
5. Below is a video demo of VRIoTPlayground. I am Unity version 2019. It works, but not well. I wonder what will happen on the Unity version 2020... Also the vertical synchronization not working well (I guess because of the picture is streamed from Oculus to PC by Wifi)

I am going to move the project to Unity 2020 first then run new XR services, let's see how it goes.
